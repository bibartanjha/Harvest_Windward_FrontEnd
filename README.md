## General

I am still working on deploying this application to a platform. Once I get that done, you can access the application by just typing a URL into the browser. 
As of now, you will need to use the terminal to access the application. 

## Usage

This application will only work on computer 10.0.25 with username harvestparsing/administrator. To use this application on a different computer, you will need to install the Windward RESTful API.

## How to access

This application is already downloaded on to this computer. To access the application, open your terminal and copy-paste this (make sure you also copy the entire block, even the empty lines):
```
cd Harvest_Windward_FrontEnd
python main.py


```

Then, type in this URL on your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8082/
