# General

I am still working on deploying this application to a platform. Once I get that done, you can access the application by just typing a URL into the browser. 
As of now, you will need to use the terminal to access the application. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
